// CS:GO autoexec.cfg by KiloSwiss -  Last Update: April/17/2020
// Download from Github: https://gist.github.com/KiloSwiss/a015b0620284ce74b5ed849ec599e51e
// This config is not meant to be used "out of the box", but to look up commands, ConVars and binds and to help you create your own personalized config.
// To get a list of all cvars, check this page by funeralchris https://github.com/funeralchris/csgo-list-of-cvars/blob/master/cvars_all.log
// If you look for an easier way to create your own config or want to copy pro players settings, check out this Map by crashz' and MisterIO:
// https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1325659427

// Feel free to edit this file, share the link with your friends, copy parts of it into your own config or even make your own config based on it.
// I recommend that you use a text editor like "Notepad++" or "Sublime" to edit this file.
// https://notepad-plus-plus.org/
// https://www.sublimetext.com/

// INSTALL:
// Put the File "autoexec.cfg" into the following folder if you want the same autoexec to be used accross multiple accounts on the same system:
//	...\SteamApps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg
//	¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
// Put the File "autoexec.cfg" into the following folder if you want separate autoexec's for each account (i.e. If you share your PC with your family/friends):
//	...\Steam\userdata\<YOURID>\730\local\cfg
//	¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
// You will see a message in the console if the autoexec gets loaded on game start and you will also hear a sound when you execute the config manually.
// If the config does NOT load automatically, then simply add "+exec autoexec" to your Launch Options.
// Here is how you do this:
// Rightclick on CS:GO in your steam library and select Properties -> Set Launch Options... -> Then add: "+exec autoexec" (without the "")
// If you have other Launch Options, keep them separated with a space. It will look like this: "-novid -tickrate 128 +exec autoexec" (without the "")
// To get a list of all available commands and console variables, type "cvarlist" (without the "") into console and press [ENTER].
// To get additional information about a specific command or console variable, use "help <command>" or "help <cvar>" (without the "").
// PRO TIP: Use the command "differences" (without the "") to get a list of all convars which are not at their default values.

// #######################
// See this picture for basic crosshair adjustments: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=799950821
// Also keep in mind that the same settings for size, thickness and gap look different on other resolutions. That means:  
// Using olofmeisters crosshair settings on 1920x1080 looks different on your screen than on his screen where he plays on 1024x768.
